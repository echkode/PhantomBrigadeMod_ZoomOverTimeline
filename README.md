# ZoomOverTimeline

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) that restores the capability to zoom the camera when the mouse cursor is over the combat timeline.

It is compatible with game release version **1.3.3**. It works with both the Steam and Epic installs of the game. All library mods are fragile and susceptible to breakage whenever a new version is released.

You used to be able to zoom the camera in or out in combat even if the mouse cursor happened to be over the combat timeline. That capability was removed in the 1.2.0 release of the game. This mod puts it back for the most part. If you have enabled the combat event log, then you can use the scroll wheel on your mouse to scroll through the messages without changing the camera zoom. Outside of the combat event log, using the scroll wheel will zoom the camera.
