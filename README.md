# ZoomOverTimeline

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) that restores the capability to zoom the camera when the mouse cursor is over the combat timeline.

It is compatible with game release version **1.2.0**. It works with both the Steam and Epic installs of the game. All library mods are fragile and susceptible to breakage whenever a new version is released.

You used to be able to zoom the camera in or out in combat even if the mouse cursor happened to be over the combat timeline. That capability was removed in the 1.2.0 release of the game. This mod puts it back but only if you have a mouse-and-keyboard setup. I added that restriction because I'm not sure why the capability was removed and it's unlikely that it was removed by accident.
